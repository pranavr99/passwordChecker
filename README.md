# Password Strength Checker

This Python program checks the strength of a user's password based on the NIST SP800-63B guidelines.

## Overview

The program consists of several components:

- **PasswordStrengthChecker Class**: This class evaluates the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, character types, repetition, and sequential patterns.

- **AppWindow Class**: Manages the graphical user interface (UI) for the password strength checker.

- **Main Function**: Initializes the UI page and adds an instance of the `AppWindow` class.

## Usage

1. **Password Input**: Users can input their desired password in the text field provided.

2. **Password Strength Analysis**: As users type their password, the program dynamically assesses its strength and provides visual feedback.

3. **Visual Feedback**: The UI displays colored bars to indicate the strength of each password criterion:
   - Red: Represents a weak criterion
   - Yellow: Indicates a moderate criterion
   - Green: Reflects a strong criterion
